- HW1: In this homework we preprocess SMS Spam Collection Dataset and train a bag-of-words classifier (logistic regression) for spam detection. 
- HW2: In this homework, we reuse the spam prediction dataset used in HW1. We will use a word-level BiLSTM sentence encoder to encode the sentence and a neural network classifier.
- HW3: In this homework, we run a Bayesian hyperparameter search for a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BoolQ dataset.
